I just read the book Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold, and decided that with my knowledge, why not make a computer! I'm building it from gates to the buses, similar to the way the book teaches this topic.

Just for a learning experience, DO NOT USE THIS ISA!
